### USING GUIDE
1. Clone this repository or just the main.py script alone is fine. 
2. Download my pretrained model in the above link. 
3. Store the model folder in the same directory/ folder as the main.py script. Or if you want to use any other model, just open the main.py script and change the *model = "path/to/your/model"*
4. My notebook is there if you want to have a look at my result, how I trained and evaluated it, or retrained it yourself.
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/Minatozaki0911/CV202.git
pip install requirement.txt
python3 main.py
```
